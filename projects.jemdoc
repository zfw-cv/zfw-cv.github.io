==Projects

All projects are open-sourced in my \[[https://github.com/Alpha-Yang Github]\]. I prefer to do 
something which really have an influence. And this page will be always updating. 

== Char-adv-using-LID-torch

There are my Pytorch codes for charactering adversarial subspace using local intrinsic dimensionality. This is a paper from Xingjun Ma publishing in ICLR'18.
What I want to do is, performing how to crafting LID examples in a single way by Pytorch which is universally used in deep learning.

== CVPR2018-Baseline-PSNRplot

This is a supplementary work after I read ShanghaiTech Paper "Future Frame Prediction for Anomaly Detection â€“ A New Baseline".
I open source my code that can visualize the psnr image of testing videos.

== cs231n-master2020

This is a work that I finished the assignment of CS231N. CS231N is a very classical computer-vision course
in Stanford University. README.md in this hub also includes the most of problems I come out and solutions to them.

== Matlab_arrowPlot

This is a work mainly for MATLAB plotting. I have sorted out two functions which can
plot something useful during your plotting.
